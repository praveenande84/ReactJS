 Class component
=======================================
These components are built using an ES6 class.
--------------------
step1 :
Create an ES6 class that extends React.Component.
The extends keyword is used to inherit methods and properties from the React.Component.
-------------------
step2 :
Add a single empty method to it called render()
The render() method is the only required method in a class component. It returns the JSX element.
