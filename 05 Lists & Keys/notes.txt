keys:
------
keys help React to identify which items have changed, added, or removed.
They should be given to the elements inside the array for a stable identity.
----------------
The best way to pick a key is to use a string that uniquely identifies a list item among its siblings.
Most often, we would use IDs (uniqueNo) from our data as keys.
